This is a java tool for game Lock On - Flaming Cliff. This applicaiton can runs on Windows PC and provide some basic flight information for game player.

This tool is a server program using JSON to communicate with game client side.

On client, it uses lua and invokes APIs provided by the game company to transmit flight information to java server application.

So if you do not have a hardware flight instrument, you can still use this small tool to show some basic flight information.

This picture is a screen capture for the application:
